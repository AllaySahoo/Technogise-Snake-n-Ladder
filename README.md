# Technogise-Snake-n-Ladder
Assignment 1 @ Technogise

Problem Statement : 

You are required to create a program, which simulates the playing of a Snakes & Ladders game.
 Board: There are 100 cells on a Snakes & Ladders board from 01, 02... all the way to 100. However, your starting
position is 00, which is outside the board.
Assumptions:
● Assume that the game has 4 snakes and 4 ladders of varying lengths dispersed on the board.
● You can choose to initialize / define where these snakes and ladders will be on the board and how long each of them
are. For e.g, a ladder could be at cell 07 and it could take you ahead to 33. Or a snake could be at 87 and bring you back to 32. It’s your choice.
Inputs and Outputs for your program:
The input to your program will be any number between 1 to 6 (...the numbers on a dice...), and your current position on the board
 The output of your program will be your new position on the board.
End of game: The game ends as soon as you reach exactly 100.

How Snakes and Ladder is played?

Player Starts at 0 , he/she rolls the dice and move his/her piece as per the number on the dice. While moving the playess' piece can land on the position where either there is a ladder or there is a snakes mouth, if there is a ladder , the player climbs it and and skips few of the middle positions , if there is a snake , the player descends by some positions.
